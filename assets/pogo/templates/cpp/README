TemplateDevServ.cpp:        Source code for the TemplateDevServ class and its commands.
                        This class is derived from DeviceImpl_2 class.
                        It represents the CORBA servant obbject which
                        will be accessed from the network.
                        All commands which can be executed on the
                        TemplateDevServ are implemented in this file.

TemplateDevServ.h:  Include for the TemplateDevServ class.
                    Server class prototypes and descriptions.

TemplateDevServClass.cpp:   A singleton class derived fromTemplateDevServ.
                        It implements the command list and all properties
                        and methods required by the TemplateDevServ once per process

TemplateDevServClass.h:	Include for the TemplateDevServClass root class.
                        This class is represents the singleton class for
                        the TemplateDevServ device class.
                        It contains all properties and methods which the 
                        TemplateDevServ requires only once e.g. the commands.

main.cpp:		C++ source for a TANGO device server main.
                        The main rule is to initialise (and create) the Tango
                        system and to create the DServerClass singleton.
                        The main should be the same for every Tango device server.

ClassFactory.cpp:	C++ source for the class_factory method of the DServer
                        device class. This method is responsible to create
                        all class singletin for a device server. It is called
                        at device server startup
